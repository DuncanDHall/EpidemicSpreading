## Check-in Notes


### Expreiment Replication 1

* What experiment are you replicating?   Who did it?  Any relevant background on the people or the publication?


* What question was their experiment intended to answer?  Is it a prediction, explanation, or design question?
 * "What is the effect of scale-free nature of networks on epidemic spreading?"(explanation)
 * In general, inspection of the effect of complex networks features on the noonquilibrium phas trnasition

* How did they go about answering it?
 * simulations & analysis of SIS model on SF graphs

* What was the result of the experiment?
 *  absence of an epidemic threshold


* How does this result answer the question?
  * SF networks are prone to the spreading and the persistence of infections whatever "spreading rate the epidemic agents possess"

* Have you replicated the experiment?  Any important details to report?

* Did the experiment replicate?  If so, how do you show that your results agree with theirs?  If not, do you understand why not?

### Plans for Extension

* What question will your experiment answer?

* What methodological changes will you have to make?

* What might the results look like?

* How will you interpret the results?


### Notes

* key words :
  - the average liftime and prevalence of viral strains
  - power-law distribution with gamma from 2 ~ 3
  - local clustering
  - "nonequilibrium phase transitions"
